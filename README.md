## Problem Statement

Classroom learning ignores diversity in people. How can AI help bridge the gap between teaching at scale and individual needs?

## Solution

We are building an AI-powered platform, which allows students to chat with historical figures, fictional characters, and even themselves. This will help students learn from the best, understand different perspectives, and even get advice from their future selves.

## Tech Stack

-   Flask
-   LLaMa
